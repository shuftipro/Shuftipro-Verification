**5. Background Checks**<br/>
**6. Phone**<br/>

## Usage: 
Below are the quick start instructions. Please follow **one** of the following the instructions to integrate Shufti Pro into your project.

### Gradle:
Step 1. Add it in your root build.gradle:

```sh
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
Step 2. Add the dependency:

```sh 
dependencies {
     implementation 'com.github.shuftipro:Shuftipro-Verification:1.0.2'
}
```

### Maven:
Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file

```sh
<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
</repositories>

```
Step 2. Add the dependency

	    <artifactId>Shuftipro-Verification</artifactId>
	    <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```

## Integration: 
See the sample project provided to learn the most common use. Make sure to build on real device.
```
import com.shufti.sdk.shuftipro.Shuftipro;
import com.shufti.sdk.shuftipro.listeners.ShuftiVerifyListener;
```
Make an instance 
```
Shuftipro instance = Shuftipro.getInstance(clientId: "your-clientId",secretKey: "your-secretKey");
```
## Sample Request
For **Sample** verification request
```sh
instance.shuftiproVerification(JSONObject: "your-requested-json-object"      
			       parentActivity: "your-caller-activity",
			       ShuftiVerifyListener: new ShuftiVerifyListener(){
				 
					@Override
					public void verificationStatus(HashMap<String, String> responseSet) {
						
					//I'm printing response here
					Log.d("Response", responseSet.toString());
				   }
			       });
```


# Request Parameters 

It is important to note here that each service module is independent of other and each one of them is activated according to the nature of request received from you. There are a total of six services which include face, document, address, consent, phone and background_checks. 

All verification services are optional. You can provide Shufti Pro a single service or mixture of several services for verifications. All keys are optional too. If a key is given in document or address sevice and no value is provided then OCR will be performed for those keys. 

* ## JSONObject

	Required: **Yes**  
	Type: **JSONObject**  

	This is the json object which we will be sent in the verifiction request.  It is important to note here that each service module is independent of other and each one of them is activated according to the nature of request received from you. There are a total of six services which include face, document, address, consent, phone and background_checks. Please consult [here](https://github.com/shuftipro/RESTful-API-v1.3/blob/master/on-site_with_ocr/on-site_with_ocr.md) for more information.

* ## parentActivity

	Required: **Yes**  
	Type: **parentActivity**  

	This is the reference of your caller activity in which you're creating an instance.

* ## shuftiVerifyListener

	Required: **Yes**  
	Type: **Interface**  

	This is the reference of your activity which implement the ShuftiVerifyListener interface.
	

## Sample Request
```sh
	JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject();
	try {
            jsonObject.put("reference", "13445566743");
            jsonObject.put("country", "GB");
            jsonObject.put("language", "EN");
            jsonObject.put("email", "yourmail@gmail.com");
            jsonObject.put("callback_url", "https://www.yourdomain.com");
            jsonObject.put("redirect_url", "");
            jsonObject.put("verification_mode", "any");
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }

        //Creating face object
        JSONObject faceObject = new JSONObject();
        try {
            faceObject.put("proof", "");
            jsonObject.put("face", faceObject);
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }
	
	//Creating document object
        JSONObject documentationObject = new JSONObject();
        ArrayList<String> doc_supported_types = new ArrayList<String>();

        doc_supported_types.add("passport");
        doc_supported_types.add("id_card");
        doc_supported_types.add("driving_license");
        doc_supported_types.add("credit_or_debit_card");

        try {
            documentationObject.put("proof", "");
            documentationObject.put("supported_types", new JSONArray(doc_supported_types));

            //Set parameters in the requested object
            documentationObject.put("name", "");
            documentationObject.put("dob", "");
            documentationObject.put("document_number", "");
            documentationObject.put("expiry_date", "");
            documentationObject.put("issue_date", "");

            jsonObject.put("document", documentationObject);
        } catch (JSONException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

	//Now, making an instance and calling the verification method
	Shuftipro instance = Shuftipro.getInstance(clientId, secretKey);
        instance.shuftiproVerification(jsonObject, HomeActivity.this, HomeActivity.this);
```

## Response Logging

Response of verification can be logged via the code given below. You can see this in LogCat at runtime. Write this code in Response listener of SDK:
```sh

//To view the errors of request
String error = responseSet.get("error");

Log.e("LoggingResp", error);

//To get the status of request
String event = responseSet.get("event");

if (event.equalsIgnoreCase("verification.accepted")) {

  //Verification accepted do whatever you want to do
  Log.i("LoggingResp", event);
} else {

  //Verification declined do whatever you want to do
  Log.i("LoggingResp", event);
}

```

## Status Response
The Shufti Pro Verification API will send a JSON response if a status request is made.

* <h3>reference</h3>
	Your unique request reference, which you provided us at the time of request, so that you can identify the response in relation to the request made.

* <h3>event</h3>

	This is the request event which shows status of request. Event is changed in every response. Please consult 
	[here](status_codes.md) for more information

## Sample project setup
In HomeActivity.java file add your **Client ID** on line 36 and **Secret Key** on line 37. Thats it!
> **Note:** Run project on a real device.
	
# Test IDs
Shufti Pro provides the users with a number of test documents. Customers may use these to test the demo, instead of presenting their actual information. <br><br>
