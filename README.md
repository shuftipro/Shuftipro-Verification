**1. Face Verification**<br />
**2. Document Verification**<br/>
**3. Address Verification**<br/>
**4. Consent Verification**<br/>
**5. Background Checks**<br/>
**6. Phone**<br/>

## Usage: 
Below are the quick start instructions. Please follow **one** of the following the instructions to integrate Shufti Pro into your project.

### Gradle:
Step 1. Add it in your root build.gradle:

```sh
allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
Step 2. Add the dependency:

```sh 
dependencies {
      implementation 'com.github.shuftipro:Shuftipro-Verification:1.2.9'
}
```

### Maven:
Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file

```sh
<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
</repositories>

```
Step 2. Add the dependency

```sh
<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.shuftipro</groupId>
	    <artifactId>Shuftipro-Verification</artifactId>
	    <version>1.2.9</version>
</dependency>
```

## Integration: 
See the sample project provided to learn the most common use. Make sure to build on real device.
```
import com.shufti.sdk.shuftipro.Shuftipro;
import com.shufti.sdk.shuftipro.listeners.ShuftiVerifyListener;
```

 Make an instance:<br>
 Instance can be created in two ways. First is by using `clientId` and `secretKey`, other one is by providing `accessToken`.<br>
 You can read more about `accessToken`[here](https://api.shuftipro.com/api/docs/#access-token)
```
//using clientId and secretKey
Shuftipro instance = Shuftipro.getInstance(clientId: "your-clientId",secretKey: "your-secretKey");

//or using accessToken
Shuftipro instance = Shuftipro.getInstance(accesstoken: "sp-accessToken");
```

 Camera Setting:<br>
 This option will returns preference for a live media captured camera directly.  <br>

 
 
```sh
 
  instance.setCaptureEnabled(true);

```

## Sample Request
For **Sample** verification request
```sh
instance.shuftiproVerification(JSONObject: "your-requested-json-object"      
			       parentActivity: "your-caller-activity",
			       ShuftiVerifyListener: new ShuftiVerifyListener(){
				 
					@Override
					public void verificationStatus(HashMap<String, String> responseSet) {
						
					//I'm printing response here
					Log.d("Response", responseSet.toString());
				   }
			       });
```



## Sample Object
```sh
	JSONObject jsonObject = new JSONObject();
	try {
            jsonObject.put("reference", "13445566743");
            jsonObject.put("country", "GB");

            jsonObject.put("verification_mode", "any");
        } catch (Exception ex) {
            ex.printStackTrace();
        }

        //Creating face object
        JSONObject faceObject = new JSONObject();
        try {
            faceObject.put("proof", "");
            jsonObject.put("face", faceObject);
        } catch (Exception ex) {

        doc_supported_types.add("passport");
        doc_supported_types.add("id_card");
        doc_supported_types.add("driving_license");
        doc_supported_types.add("credit_or_debit_card");

        try {
            documentationObject.put("proof", "");
            documentationObject.put("supported_types", new JSONArray(doc_supported_types));

            //Set parameters in the requested object
            documentationObject.put("name", "");
            documentationObject.put("dob", "");
            documentationObject.put("document_number", "");

	//Now, making an instance and calling the verification method
	Shuftipro instance = Shuftipro.getInstance(clientId, secretKey);
        instance.shuftiproVerification(jsonObject, HomeActivity.this, HomeActivity.this);
```

# Verification Request

Whenever a request for verification from a user is received, Shufti Pro’s intelligent system determines the nature of verification through parameters given below. These parameters enable Shufti Pro to:

1. Identify its customers
2. Check authenticity of client’s credentials
3. Read client’s data
4. Decide what information is being sent to perform that verification 

# Request Parameters

It is important to note here that each service module is independent of other and each one of them is activated according to the nature of request received from you. There are a total of six services which include face, document, address, consent, phone and background_checks.

All verification services are optional. You can provide Shufti Pro a single service or mixture of several services for verifications. All keys are optional too. If a key is given in document or address sevice and no value is provided then OCR will be performed for those keys. 

* ## reference

  Required: **Yes**  
  Type: **string**  
  Minimum: **6 characters**  
  Maximum: **250 characters**

  This is the unique reference ID of request, which we will send you back with each response, so you can verify the request. Only alphanumeric values are allowed. This reference can be used to get status of already performed verification requests.


* ## country

  Required: **No**  
  Type: **string**  
  Length: **2 characters**

  Send the 2 characters long [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) country code of where your customer is from. Please consult [Supported Countries](https://github.com/shuftipro/RESTful-API-v1.3/blob/master/off-site_without_ocr/countries.md) for country codes.

* ## language

  Required: **No**  
  Type: **string**  
  Length: **2 characters**

  Send the 2 characters long language code of your preferred language to display the verification screens accordingly. Please consult [Supported Languages](https://github.com/shuftipro/RESTful-API-v1.3/blob/master/off-site_without_ocr/languages.md) for language codes. Default language english will be selected if this key is missing in the request.

* ## email

  Required: **No**  
  Type: **string**  
  Minimum: **6 characters**  
  Maximum: **128 characters**

  This field represents email of the end-user. If it is missing in a request, than Shuftpro will ask the user for its email in an on-site request.

* ## callback_url

  Required: **No**  
  Type: **string**  
  Minimum: **6 characters**  
  Maximum: **250 characters**

  During a verification request, we make several server to server calls to keep you updated about the verification state. This way you can update the request status at your end even if the customer is lost midway through the process.

* ## verification_mode

  Required: **No**  
  Type: **string**  
  Accepted Values: **any, image_only, video_only**

  Verification mode defines what types of proofs are allowed for a verification. In case of 'video_only' user will upload videos and images if verification mode is 'image_only'.

500           | Server Error         | internal server error


## Response Logging

Response of verification can be logged via the code given below. You can see this in LogCat at runtime. Write this code in Response listener of SDK:
```sh

//To view the errors of request
String error = responseSet.get("error");

Log.e("LoggingResp", error);

//To get the status of request
String event = responseSet.get("event");

if (event.equalsIgnoreCase("verification.accepted")) {

  //Verification accepted do whatever you want to do
  Log.i("LoggingResp", event);
} else {

  //Verification declined do whatever you want to do
  Log.i("LoggingResp", event);
}

```

## Status Response
The Shufti Pro Verification API will send a JSON response if a status request is made.

* <h3>reference</h3>
	Your unique request reference, which you provided us at the time of request, so that you can identify the response in relation to the request made.

* <h3>event</h3>

	This is the request event which shows status of request. Event is changed in every response. Please consult 
	[here](status_codes.md) for more information

* <h3>response</h3>
    
    	This key has the complete response received from ShuftiPro.

## Sample project setup
